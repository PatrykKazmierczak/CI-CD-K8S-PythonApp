# Monitoring-and-Continuous-Integration-with-Kubernetes
Project Steps:

# 1. Setup Kubernetes Cluster:<br>
• Use a tool like Minikube or kind to set up a local Kubernetes cluster for development and testing.

# 2. Create a Simple Web Application:<br>
• Develop a basic web application using your preferred programming language (e.g., Node.js, Python, Go).<br>
• Create a Dockerfile to containerize your application.

# 3. Containerize the Application:<br>
• Build a Docker image of your web application.<br>
• Push the Docker image to a container registry (e.g., Docker Hub, Google Container Registry).

# 4. Kubernetes Deployment:<br>
• Create Kubernetes manifests (YAML files) for deploying your application.<br>
• Deploy your application on Kubernetes using kubectl or a CI/CD tool.

# 5. Implement Monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana:<br>
• Install Prometheus and Grafana on your Kubernetes cluster.<br>
• Configure Prometheus to scrape metrics from your application.<br>
• Set up Grafana dashboards to visualize the collected metrics.

# 6. Implement Continuous Integration with CircleCI:<br>
• Create a CircleCI configuration file (.circleci/config.yml) in your project repository.<br>
• Configure CircleCI to build your Docker image, push it to the container registry, and deploy it to Kubernetes.

# 7. Implement Continuous Integration with Jenkins:<br>
• Set up a Jenkins server either locally or in your Kubernetes cluster.<br>
• Create a Jenkins pipeline or job to build and deploy your application.<br>
• Configure Jenkins to trigger the pipeline/job whenever changes are pushed to your repository.

# 8. Testing and Automation:<br>
• Implement unit tests and integration tests for your web application.<br>
• Integrate testing into your CI/CD pipelines to ensure code quality.

# 9. Documentation:<br>
• Document the project setup, including instructions for setting up the development environment, deploying to Kubernetes, and configuring CI/CD pipelines.

# 10. Demo and Presentation:<br>
• Prepare a presentation or demonstration of your project to showcase how everything works together.
